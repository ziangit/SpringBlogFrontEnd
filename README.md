## Future Features

I am constantly working to improve NgSpringBlogFrontend and expand its capabilities. Here are a few features I am planning to implement in the future:

### Search

In a future version of NgSpringBlogFrontend, I plan to implement a search feature. This will allow users to easily find specific posts by searching for keywords in the post titles or content.

### Admin Realm

I am also working on adding an admin realm. This feature will allow admins to manage users and posts in a more streamlined and efficient way. 

### User Interaction

To enhance user engagement, I am planning to add comment, reply, rate the post and other features to make the blog more interactive



## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
